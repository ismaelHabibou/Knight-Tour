# Knight-Tour
The knight tour problem is an ancient that is traced back to the ancient civilization of Indians and Arabs. The problem consists of moving the knight on the chessboard and the knight should visit every cell and only once. The problem was solved in 1823 by the mathematician and logician Leonardo Euler. I have solved the problem using recursion, but my solution is not elegant, and it is inefficient. An efficient solution. After some research, I found out that it is possible to solve the problem using graph theory and an algorithm called depth-first search. Right now, I am not comfortable with graph theory and trees but as soon as I get what graph theory is all about, I will update my solution.
