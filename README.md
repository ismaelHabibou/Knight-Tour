# Knight-Tour
The knight tour problem is a problem that found its origin in the ancient hindu and arab civilizations . The problem consists of moving the knight on a chessboard and the knight should visit every cell and only once. The problem was solved in 1823 by the mathematician and logician Leonardo Euler. 
I have solved the problem using recursion, but my solution is not elegant. After some research, I found out that it is possible to solve the problem using graph theory and an algorithm called depth-first search. Right now, I am not comfortable with graph theory and trees but as soon as I get what graph theory is all about, I will update my solution.
